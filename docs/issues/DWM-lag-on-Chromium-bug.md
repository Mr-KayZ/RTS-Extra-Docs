## Background
Symptoms of users mainly indicate issues with Electron or Chromium based services since the update to Windows 11 24H2 (at the time of writing, this bug still persists in 25H2). Services include applications such as Discord, Visual Studio Code, and even Chromium based browsers such as Edge or Chrome itself, particularly when the user alt-tabs from a GPU heavy process such as a video game or equivalent.
