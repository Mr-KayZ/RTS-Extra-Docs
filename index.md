## Purpose of this Wiki

Hello! This is a personal extension of the [r/techsupport wiki](https://rtech.support/) that explores more obscure and unknown tech issues and provides unique fixes beyond standard troubleshooting methods.

This wiki serves as a resource for solving rare and perplexing technical problems with innovative solutions. (Also because I can update this faster than the official r/techsupport wiki lol.)

It also serves as a personal notes collection of which that allows me to quickly refer to issues and topics I would need further reading on (especially if not documented in the Wiki at the time of writing).

In addition, this will serve as my personal blog of sorts so you can view my totally valid opinions on subjects I definitely have a say on /s. Feel free to explore!
